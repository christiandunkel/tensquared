The 2D puzzle platformer **tensquared** was made in Unity for the *8-bit Bauhaus* study project in the summer semester of 2019 at the *Bauhaus University Weimar*. The project was started to create a number of Bauhaus-themed games in order to celebrate 100 years of Bauhaus. See the [documentation](/Documentation/Documentation.md) for more information.

The game is being developed by **Christian** (Programming), **Nyiko** (Animation, Graphics) and **Raphael** (Audio, Graphics). The game is currently in *live development*. You can download the project up to the newest commit, or one of the releases, and play it in the Unity editor or build it. The game in its newest version requires **Unity version 2019.1.4f1**. A newer version than that should work fine as well, probably.

What is *Bauhaus*? The Bauhaus was originally a German art school founded in Weimar by Walter Gropius, being operational from 1919 to 1933. Later, new schools in two German cities, Dessau and Berlin, were founded. Today, upholding modernism, rationality and functionality, the Bauhaus lives on as a way of design in art, architecture and industrial design.
