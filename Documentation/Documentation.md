## Background
From the very beginning, we set out to create a game in *2D*. We gathered ideas, and it quickly became obvious that we wanted to work on, and combine, parkour and puzzle elements in our game. In spirit of the Bauhaus, we decided to make our main protagonist, but a geometric shape, a circle to be exact.

// IMAGE, different character designs

## Design
The first draft for a general look of the levels was done in a heart-beat, with a simple paper-esque texture style, in an environment that combines nature with industrial elements.
// IMAGE, first level look
// TODO, changes in the future, two different art styles (natural & destroyed), lighting

## Story
Now, it was time to think about a story for our game. We met, and started throwing around a few ideas, but after a while, there wasn't much that could be called a 'big idea' or a 'complex plot'. We considered incorporating the history of the Bauhaus into the game, especially the dark years of the Third Reich, but it didn't fit that well with out overall concept, especially the non-human main character.  However, after a while, the suggestion for a sarcastic robot narrator came up, and we quickly focused our story efforts on this element, and crafted a rough story board around it.

## Implementation
For the first three weeks, we focused on outlining our game idea, while getting more familiar with the Unity engine in the process. We collected ideas for the story, as well as, game-play mechanics and for the level design.
