## Background
From the very beginning, we set out to create a game in *2D*. We gathered ideas, and it quickly became apparent that we wanted to integrate parkour and puzzle elements into our game. In the spirit of the Bauhaus, we settled on making our playable character a geometric shape, a circle to be exact. The character would be able to move between different geometric shapes, that would each possess different physical attributes and abilities.

## Story
When deciding on a story for our game, we started throwing around a few ideas, but there wasn't a 'big idea' among them at first. We considered incorporating the history of the Bauhaus into the game, especially the dark years of the Third Reich, but it didn't fit that well with our overall concept and especially the non-human main character.  However, after a while, the suggestion for a sarcastic robot narrator came up, and we quickly focused our story efforts on this element and crafted a rough storyboard around it.

The story was altered multiple times over the duration of the game's development, but the core of it remained very similar to what we first envisioned. The player would wake up, and not know what it was, how it got there, and what it could do. Over the course of the game, it would learn new skills and slowly help the robot narrator find the body parts it had lost. However, one of those parts would be damaged already, making the robot slowly malfunction after it reattached it. The robot would turn from a friendly helper to the antagonist of the story.

## Design
The first draft for a general look of the levels was done in a heartbeat, with a simple paper design style, in an environment that combines nature with industrial elements.

Over the development of the game, we added many new elements to enrich the game's world. To make it look beautiful, we decided to use soft light shapes, which would replace the Unity in-built lights, that we tried to use in the beginning and which turned out to be unsuited for our 2D art style.

The further the player gets into the levels, the more destroyed and industrial they would appear, following the robot narrator slowly but surely losing its mind. Moreover, in the final stage of development, we also decided to make the next-to-last level happen at sunset, and the last level, where the story would reach its climax, would play entirely at night.

## Implementation
For the first three weeks of the project, we focused on outlining our game's design style, story, and mechanics, while getting more familiar with the Unity engine in the process. We ended up with a rough understanding of the engine, and a fully working main menu, options menu, level menu and some other important parts of the final framework for the game, including scripts to manage the player progress, settings and sound.

Over the following weeks, we began developing the first level and implementing new mechanics, that would be needed for future levels. We introduced the underlying physics and different managers into the game, including controllers for scripted events and dialogue. We decided to use a text-based dialogue system, in addition to a spoken robot voice to make the story feel more action-heavy and humorous, and less like a dump of text for the player to digest.

In the first days of June, we finally completed the first level, and, with it, the framework for all future levels. Then it was time to expand the story and build new levels. For that, we also began working on enemies and new obstacles the player would have to face in the later part of the game. New designs were drawn to make the last levels appear more chaotic and make the player feel a sense of unease while making the robot narrator act more and more sporadic. This task took until the final deadline in July, when we finally completed the game and showcased it at the 2019 summary of the *Bauhaus University of Weimar*.
