# tensquared

The 2D puzzle platformer **tensquared** is a three-man project and was made in Unity for the *8-Bit of Bauhaus* study project in the summer semester of 2019 at the *Bauhaus University Weimar*. The project was started to create a number of Bauhaus-themed games in order to celebrate 100 years of Bauhaus.

See the [documentation](/Documentation/Documentation.md) for more information.

You can download the project up to the newest commit, or select one of the releases. You can play it in the Unity editor or build it. The game in its newest version requires **Unity version 2019.1.4f1**. A newer version will probably work fine as well.

## Summary

You are a circle. Awakened in the middle of a remote forest, you don't know how you got there and have no idea of where to go. But suddenly, you hear a metallic voice, and the robot speaker is guiding you out of the wilderness. You finally meet the robot that helped you, and you discover that it has lost significant parts of its body. The robot requests your help, and together, you go on a journey to recover the missing limbs. On the way, you learn more about the world around you, as well as discover your peculiar abilities.  And there's nothing that could go horribly wrong in this the whole story.

**tensquared** is a puzzle platform game, where you discover a fascinating 2D world as a circle. You can morph into the form of a triangle and rectangle, where you gain new abilities and properties to overcome obstacles while exploring the world. You are also on a quest by a robot to recover the lost parts of its body. In this search, the story, that is as much about the robot as it is about you, will unfold.

## What is Bauhaus?

[![Bauhaus Logo](/Documentation/Images/bauhaus_logo_large.png)](#)

The Bauhaus was originally a German art school founded in Weimar by Walter Gropius, being operational from 1919 to 1933. Later, new schools in two German cities, Dessau and Berlin, were founded. Today, upholding modernism, rationality and functionality, the Bauhaus lives on as a way of design in art, architecture and industrial design.
